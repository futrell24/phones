				<h1>Jailbreaking 101</h1>
				<!--Description -->
				<p><b><i>Free your phone!</b></i></p>
				<p>The term jailbreak is referred to Apple iPhones and was first used after the phone was released in 2007. When jailbreaking your iPhone you can add custom notification sounds, ringtones, phones overall functions, and more. It gives your phone lots of great tweaks that did not come on the phone. 
				These tweaks also give you the ability to have more options for organizing and managing files and app files on the iPhone without restrictions. 
				You can use this app called iFile to duplicate and interchange files, transfer files over a web server, and give fixed permissions on files. 
				Many phone sellers like to buy jail-broken devices because it allows them to make it universal for all companies. I will provide a link on the sources tab located on the 
				menu bar for steps in completing this objective to jailbreak your phone!
