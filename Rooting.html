				<h1>Rooting 101</h1>
				<!--Description -->
				<p><b><i>Its an Android World!</b></i></p>
				<p>When someone says rooting it refers to Android operating phones. When rooting your phone it can significantly advance its performance when downloading custom ROMs. These custom ROMs gives you the ability to fully customize 
				the phone and tweak your phones speeds. Tweaking the phones speed is done by downloading apps that require root access to overclock the phone’s processor. Many custom ROMs have added support for the use of proxy and VPN. 
				Another great thing about rooting is that you can turn your phone into a Wi-Fi hotspot so you and your friends and family can connect to their laptop or other devices to the internet through its phone provider services over 
				a 3G or 4G network. This is done without paying an extra monthly expense to the carrier a big plus in my book. Unlike the iPhone’s jailbreak method the android phones all have their own rooting method depending on your phone type.
